# Student Salary Prediction Project

A comprehensive machine learning project to predict student salaries based on educational background, work experience, and academic performance.

## üìä Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the expected salary of students based on their complete educational journey - from schooling through MBA, including work experience and specialization details.

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Preprocess and clean the dataset
3. Engineer relevant features
4. Build and compare multiple regression models
5. Optimize the best performing model
6. Deploy the model for salary predictions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Model Deployment**: Flask/FastAPI (optional)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub


## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

Key areas of investigation:
- Distribution of target variable (Salary)
- Correlation between academic performance and salary
- Impact of work experience on salary
- Effect of different specializations on earning potential
- Gender-based salary differences
- Board and stream preferences vs salary outcomes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Values
- Identify and impute missing values appropriately
- Use domain knowledge for intelligent imputation

### Feature Engineering
- Create composite academic performance scores
- Encode categorical variables (One-Hot, Label Encoding)
- Normalize/Standardize numerical features
- Handle skewed distributions

### Categorical Encoding
- Board types (SSC, HSC)
- Stream specializations
- Degree courses
- MBA specializations
- Entrance test types

## ü§ñ Modeling Approach

### Algorithms to Implement
1. **Linear Regression** (Baseline)
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
4. **XGBoost Regressor**
5. **LightGBM Regressor**
6. **Support Vector Regressor**
7. **Neural Networks** (Optional)

### Evaluation Metrics
- **R-squared** (Primary metric)
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

### Validation Strategy
- Train-Test Split (80-20)
- 
- Cross-Validation (5-fold)
- Stratified sampling based on key features
